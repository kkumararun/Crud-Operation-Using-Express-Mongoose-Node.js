Crude operations using Mongoose with Mongodb.

I have created Api's in app.js file with get and post methods
rather than the put or delete.

in index.html we have created Multiple forms

Step 1 :
i have created Book.model.js schema for my Book table

Step 2:
Code into app.js file and created api's for Crud operations

Note : If you don't want to create database manually so enter the Data First
       than it'll create the Collection automatically

localhost Server Port No is : 3000
